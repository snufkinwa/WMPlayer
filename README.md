Replica of a Window Media Player skin for my Windows XP portfolio. It plays audio, and looks cool. Credit to the people who made this skin is below. Found on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/windowsmediaplayerskinscollection).

I wanted something that really drove it home that we were on a 2000s XP desktop. I made this to put in an iframe and import into my project. 

## Installation

This is a HTML, JS, CSS project. To use its best to add the url to an iframe and import into a project as needed.

## Usage

```
<iframe src="[future github url]" 
frameBorder="0" title="wmplayer" 
class="wmp-iframe" />
```
Make draggable with additional code.
